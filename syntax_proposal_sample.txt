- The following text looks more like markup or markdown language
  rather than yaml. So, I use 'txt' rather than 'yml' as file extensions.

- More advanced features in yaml like maps and objects
  are to be taken care of in later versions.

- begin of sample

- sample v20200220_2008

- some text

- some long text
  that cross multiple lines

- some complex text
  - by complex I mean there is some sub-text attached to the parent text
  - maybe more than one sub-text

- this is also complex text
  - complex text can be nested
    - like this
      - and this
  - blah
  - blah blah
  - blah blah blah

- sub-text can be long text too
  - like this
    blah blah blah
    - and this
      blah blah blah 
  - and this
    blah blah blah

- end of sample
