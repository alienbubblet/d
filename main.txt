    YAML - pure perl script solution
    YAML::XS - libyaml binding (YAML 1.1)

    I choose YAML::XS.

    It is more consistent since in other programming languages, say python,
    there should be some binding to libyaml too.

    Another reason is that YAML does not support double-quoted strings
    that cross multiple lines.
