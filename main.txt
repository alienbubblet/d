-
  - redesign of diaryup project

-
  - some modules that might be useful for this project
  - 
  - Digest and Digest::MD5
  - MIME::Base64 and pack and unpack


- some useful modules
-
  - Digest and Digest::MD5

- Might need YAML prettifier (aka beautifier)


- begin of done

- Determine how to apply yaml (20200223)
-
  - The result is syntax_draft.yml .


- Determine which YAML::* modules to parse yaml files.
-
  - |
    YAML - pure perl script solution
    YAML::XS - libyaml binding (YAML 1.1)

    I choose YAML::XS.

    It is more consistent since in other programming languages, say python,
    there should be some binding to libyaml too.

    Another reason is that YAML does not support double-quoted strings
    that cross multiple lines.

- end of done
